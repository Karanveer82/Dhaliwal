Data Warehouse is a relational database management system (RDBMS) construct to meet the requirement of transaction processing systems. 
It can be loosely described as any centralized data repository which can be queried for business benefits. It is a database that stores information oriented to satisfy decision-making requests. 
It is a group of decision support technologies, targets to enabling the knowledge worker (executive, manager, and analyst) to make superior and higher decisions. 
So, Data Warehousing support architectures and tool for business executives to systematically organize, understand and use their information to make strategic decisions.
Data Warehouse environment contains an extraction, transportation, and loading (ETL) solution, an online analytical processing (OLAP) engine, customer analysis tools, and other applications that handle the process of gathering information and delivering it to business users.
A Data Warehouse (DW) is a relational database that is designed for query and analysis rather than transaction processing. It includes historical data derived from transaction data from single and multiple sources.
A Data Warehouse provides integrated, enterprise-wide, historical data and focuses on providing support for decision-makers for data modeling and analysis.
A Data Warehouse is a group of data specific to the entire organization, not only to a particular group of users.
It is not used for daily operations and transaction processing but used for making decisions.
A Data Warehouse can be viewed as a data system with the following attributes:
It is a database designed for investigative tasks, using data from various applications.
It supports a relatively small number of clients with relatively long interactions.
It includes current and historical data to provide a historical perspective of information.
Its usage is read-intensive.
It contains a few large tables.
A data warehouse, or enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system that aggregates data from different sources into a single, central, consistent data store to support data analysis, data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. A data warehouse system enables an organization to run powerful analytics on huge volumes (petabytes and petabytes) of historical data in ways that a standard database cannot.
Data warehousing systems have been a part of business intelligence (BI) solutions for over three decades, but they have evolved recently with the emergence of new data types and data hosting methods.
Traditionally, a data warehouse was hosted on-premises—often on a mainframe computer—and its functionality was focused on extracting data from other sources, cleansing and preparing the data, and loading and maintaining the data in a relational database. 
More recently, a data warehouse might be hosted on a dedicated appliance or in the cloud, and most data warehouses have added analytics capabilities and data visualization and presentation tools.
A data warehouse is a centralised repository that stores structured data (database tables, Excel sheets) and semi-structured data (XML files, webpages) for the purposes of reporting and analysis. 
The data flows in from a variety of sources, such as point-of-sale systems, business applications, and relational databases, and it is usually cleaned and standardised before it hits the warehouse. 
Because a data warehouse can store large amounts of information, it provides users with easy access to a wealth of historical data, which can be used for data mining, data visualisation, and other forms of business intelligence reporting.
A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics. 
Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data. 
The data within a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide range of sources such as application log files and transaction applications.
A data warehouse centralizes and consolidates large amounts of data from multiple sources. 
Its analytical capabilities allow organizations to derive valuable business insights from their data to improve decision-making. 
Over time, it builds a historical record that can be invaluable to data scientists and business analysts. 
Because of these capabilities, a data warehouse can be considered an organization’s “single source of truth.”
A relational database to store and manage data.
An extraction, loading, and transformation (ELT) solution for preparing the data for analysis.
Statistical analysis, reporting, and data mining capabilities.
Client analysis tools for visualizing and presenting data to business users.
Other, more sophisticated analytical applications that generate actionable information by applying data science and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, or graph and spatial features that enable more kinds of analysis of data at scale.
The data warehouse serves as the functional foundation for middleware BI environments that provide end users with reports, dashboards, and other interfaces.
Subject-oriented They can analyze data about a particular subject or functional area (such as sales).
Integrated Data warehouses create consistency among different data types from disparate sources.
Nonvolatile Once data is in a data warehouse, it’s stable and doesn’t change.
Time-variant Data warehouse analysis looks at change over time.
A cloud data warehouse uses the cloud to ingest and store data from disparate data sources.
The original data warehouses were built with on-premises servers. 
These on-premises data warehouses continue to have many advantages today. 
In many cases, they can offer improved governance, security, data sovereignty, and better latency. 
However, on-premises data warehouses are not as elastic and they require complex forecasting to determine how to scale the data warehouse for future needs. 
Managing these data warehouses can also be very complex.
A modern data architecture addresses those different needs by providing a way to manage all data types, workloads, and analysis. 
It consists of architecture patterns with necessary components integrated to work together in alignment with industry best practices.
A converged database that simplifies management of all data types and provides different ways to use data.
Self-service data ingestion and transformation services.
Support for SQL, machine learning, graph, and spatial processing.
