1. Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets. 
2. Given the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated over the last couple of decades, assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge. However, despite the fact that that technology continuously evolves to handle data at a large-scale, leaders still face challenges with scalability and automation.
3. Data mining has improved organizational decision-making through insightful data analyses. 
4. These methods are used to organize and filter data, surfacing the most interesting information, from fraud detection to user behaviors, bottlenecks, and even security breaches.
5. When combined with data analytics and visualization tools, like Apache Spark, delving into the world of data mining has never been easier and extracting relevant insights has never been faster. Advances within artificial intelligence only continue to expedite adoption across industries.
6. Set the business objectives This can be the hardest part of the data mining process, and many organizations spend too little time on this important step. Data scientists and business stakeholders need to work together to define the business problem, which helps inform the data questions and parameters for a given project. 
7. Data preparation Once the scope of the problem is defined, it is easier for data scientists to identify which set of data will help answer the pertinent questions to the business. Once they collect the relevant data, the data will be cleaned, removing any noise, such as duplicates, missing values, and outliers. 
8. Depending on the dataset, an additional step may be taken to reduce the number of dimensions as too many features can slow down any subsequent computation. Data scientists will look to retain the most important predictors to ensure optimal accuracy within any models.
9. Model building and pattern mining Depending on the type of analysis, data scientists may investigate any interesting data relationships, such as sequential patterns, association rules, or correlations. While high frequency patterns have broader applications, sometimes the deviations in the data can be more interesting, highlighting areas of potential fraud.
10. Deep learning algorithms may also be applied to classify or cluster a data set depending on the available data. 
11. If the input data is labelled (i.e. supervised learning), a classification model may be used to categorize data, or alternatively, a regression may be applied to predict the likelihood of a particular assignment. 
12. If the dataset isnâ€™t labelled (i.e. unsupervised learning), the individual data points in the training set are compared with one another to discover underlying similarities, clustering them based on those characteristics.
13. By observing consumer demographics and online user behavior, companies can use data to optimize their marketing campaigns, improving segmentation, cross-sell offers, and customer loyalty programs, yielding higher ROI on marketing efforts. 
14. Predictive analyses can also help teams to set expectations with their stakeholders, providing yield estimates from any increases or decreases in marketing investment.
15. Educational institutions have started to collect data to understand their student populations as well as which environments are conducive to success. 
16. As courses continue to transfer to online platforms, they can use a variety of dimensions and metrics to observe and evaluate performance, such as keystroke, student profiles, classes, universities, time spent, etc.
17. Process mining leverages data mining techniques to reduce costs across operational functions, enabling organizations to run more efficiently. 
18. This practice has helped to identify costly bottlenecks and improve decision-making among business leaders.
19. While frequently occurring patterns in data can provide teams with valuable insight, observing data anomalies is also beneficial, assisting companies in detecting fraud. 
20. While this is a well-known use case within banking and other financial institutions, SaaS-based companies have also started to adopt these practices to eliminate fake user accounts from their datasets.
21. Data mining is the process of analyzing a large batch of information to discern trends and patterns.
22. Data mining can be used by corporations for everything from learning about what customers are interested in or want to buy to fraud detection and spam filtering.
23. Data mining programs break down patterns and connections in data based on what information users request or provide.
24. Social media companies use data mining techniques to commodify their users in order to generate profit.
25. This use of data mining has come under criticism lately as users are often unaware of the data mining happening with their personal information, especially when it is used to influence preferences.
26. Data mining programs analyze relationships and patterns in data based on what users request.For example, a company can use data mining software to create classes of information. 
27. To illustrate, imagine a restaurant wants to use data mining to determine when it should offer certain specials.
28. It looks at the information it has collected and creates classes based on when customers visit and what they order.
29. In other cases, data miners find clusters of information based on logical relationships or look at associations and sequential patterns to draw conclusions about trends in consumer behavior.
30. Warehousing is an important aspect of data mining. Warehousing is when companies centralize their data into one database or program. 
31. With a data warehouse, an organization may spin off segments of the data for specific users to analyze and use. 
32. However, in other cases, analysts may start with the data they want and create a data warehouse based on those specs.
33. Association rules, also referred to as market basket analysis, searches for relationships between variables. 
34. This relationship in itself creates additional value within the data set as it strives to link pieces of data. 
35. For example, association rules would search a company's sales history to see which products are most commonly purchased together; with this information, stores can plan, promote, and forecast accordingly.
36. Classification uses predefined classes to assign to objects. 
37. These classes describe characteristics of items or represent what the data points have in common with each. 
38. This data mining technique allows the underlying data to be more neatly categorized and summarized across similar features or product lines.
39. Clustering is similar to classification. However, clustering identified similarities between objects, then groups those items based on what makes them different from other items. While classification may result in groups such as "shampoo", "conditioner", "soap", and "toothpaste", clustering may identify groups such as "hair care" and "dental health".
40.Decision trees are used to classify or predict an outcome based on a set list of criteria or decisions.
41. A decision tree is used to ask for input of a series of cascading questions that sort the dataset based on responses given. 
42. Sometimes depicted as a tree-like visual, a decision tree allows for specific direction and user input when drilling deeper into the data.
43. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is an algorithm that classifies data based on its proximity to other data.
44. The basis for KNN is rooted in the assumption that data points that are close to each are more similar to each other than other bits of data.
45. This non-parametric, supervised technique is used to predict features of a group based on individual data points.
46. Neural networks process data through the use of nodes. These nodes is comprised of inputs, weights, and an output. 
47. Data is mapped through supervised learning (similar to how the human brain is interconnected). 
48. This model can be fit to give threshold values to determine a model's accuracy.
49. Predictive analysis strives to leverage historical information to build graphical or mathematical models to forecast future outcomes. 
50. Overlapping with regression analysis, this data mining technique aims at supporting an unknown figure in the future based on current data on hand.
51. Data mining ensures a company is collecting and analyzing reliable data. It is often a more rigid, structured process that formally identifies a problem, gathers data related to the problem, and strives to formulate a solution.
